# HuduScripts
Location for Hudu Scripts created by the community, not officially supported by Hudu

## Community created KB Import scripts
For ITGlue users stuck on a basic plan without any API Keys, this script can pull the content from the HTML Files that are the format given in an Export of ITGlue and recreate the KB Articles ONLY in Hudu.

Asset layout (flexible Assets) and passwords are not yet supported, but can be added to if you are willing to provide examples of how the data is presented.

An example template of the CSV File is included although this will be given by ITGlue along with the export.
